# CourseApp-Back-end

## Pre-project exercise on Django: Echo model

In the project application `api` an Echo model is created in `models.py` for the pre-project exercise. The browsing of Echo instances can be accessed using http://localhost:8000/api/echos/.
The application `api` itself will be used to complete the Course App project as more necessary components are added to `models.py`, `views.py`, `serializers.py`, `urls.py`, etc...
